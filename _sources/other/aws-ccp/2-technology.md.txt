## Compute
### EC2
```
- AMI - Amazon Machine Image - This is a template for the OS to install on an EC2
- 750 compute hours on the "Free Tier" plan

```
```
- can be accessed over: 
    - management console         - Through a webshell
    - ssh                        - With ssh keys 
    - EC2 Instance Connect (EIC) - Uses IAM policies to control ssh access
    - AWS Systems Manager        - Through a webshell
```
```
- pricing options: 
    - On-Demand                  - Fixed price based on instance type, no contract, you pay only for what you use
    - Spot                       - Your request will only be fulfilled if capacity is available, cheap, usefull if we don't care when you jobs run
    - Reserved  Instances        - Commit for 1 or 3 year term
    - Dedicated Hosts            - Pay for a dedicated physical server, e.g. not shared with other apps and users
    - Savings Plans              - Commit to compute usage (measured per hours) for 1 or 3 years
```
```
- EC2 Elastic Load Balancing     - Distributes your incoming app traffic across multiple EC2
                                 - Classic load balancers
                                 - Application load balancers

                                 - Network load balancers
```
```
- EC2 - Auto Scaling             - Adds or replaces EC2 instances automatically across AZs, based on need and changing demand 
                                 - Horizontal scaling  (add servers)
                                 - Scaling out         (remove servers)
```
### Lambda
```
- Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without managing servers
- in the lambda vernacular app code is called functions 
- scales automatically
- lambda functions have a 15 min timeout.
- supports - java, go, powershell, node.js, C#, python, ruby
```
```
- pricing model
    - you are charged based on the duration and number of requests
    - 1 Compute Time
    - 2 Request count
    - 3 Always free - 1 million requests for free each month even after the free tier is expired
```

> node.js code to try as a lambda function
```javascript
const https = require('https')
let url = "https://www.amazon.com"

exports.handler = function(event, context, callback) {
    https.get(url, (res) => {
        callback(null, res.statusCode)
    }).on('error', (e) => {
        callback(Error(e))
    })
}
```

> python code to try as a lambda function
```python
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    message = 'Hello {} {}! Keep being awesome!'.format(event['first_name'], event['last_name'])  

    #print to CloudWatch logs
