# Foundations of Cloud Computing 

## Terminology
```
High Availability (HA)        - always on
Elasticity                    - scalable
Agility                       - inovate faster 
Durability                    - long-term data protection
Capital Expenditures (CapEx)  - fixed assets -> server
Operating Expenditures (OpEx) - day to day -> salary
```

## 6 Advantages 
1. Go global in minutes
2. Stop spending money running and maitaining data centers
3. Benefit from massive economies of scale
4. Increase speed and agility
5. Stop guessing capacity
6. Trade capital expense for variable expense

## Cloud computing models
```
IaaS - Infrastructure As A Service - ex: a VPS  
SaaS - Software As A Service       - ex: a WebMail service
PaaS - Platform As A Service       - ex: a Storefront Website (typically a tool used by devs to build aps)
```

## Cloud deployement models
```
Private Cloud - On prem
Public Cloud  - AWS
Hybrid Cloud  - Mix of the 2 with "Direct Connect"
```

## Geographic locations 
```
us east
us west
South America
Europe 
Asia Pacific
Africa
```
> each geos has regions 

## regions (in US East )
```
Ohio
North Virginia
```
> each region has AZs

## Availability Zone (AZ) (in N. Virginia) 
```
US-EAST-1A
US-EAST-1B
US-EAST-1C
US-EAST-1D
US-EAST-1E
US-EAST-1F
```
> availability zones have multiple data-centers  
> if one AZ goes down, the next one should not  
> deploying in multiple AZs should provide HA


## Edge locations
> CDNs  
> there are more edge locations than AZs, they do not run the infra for your app  
> but permit low latency for your application.  
> leveraged by "Amazon CloudFront"
