```

## ISO 14443 A - Range up to 10 cm
```
Higher operating power
Operates in the 13.56MHz 
Originally designed for contactless financial transactions
Ironically, became wildly popular for access control systems
Some but not all ISO14443A chips are also considered NFC compliant.
Still used for nearly all contactless payment standards and services including:
EMV cards, 
Apple Pay, 
Google Pay, 
Samsung Pay, 
etc. 
```

## ISO 15693   - Range up to 100 cm
```
Lower operating power
Operates in the 13.56MHz 
Originally designed for access control systems
Popular use in inventory control (libraries ski pass and stuff). 
```

## ISO 18000   - International standard 
```
describes various other RFID technologies, 
each using a unique frequency range.
